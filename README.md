**As part of my minimalism,**
**all projects that I consider no longer useful will be removed after post-mortem,**
**even if they are well developed.**
**If you are highly dependent on one of my repositories, it is recommended that you back it up manually.**

## Stages of Projects
- 🌱 A start-up or experimental project.
- 🌿 A relatively stable project, may be rewritten.
- 🌲 A developed project.
- 🌳 A very developed project that is difficult to improve further.
- 🍂 A project that is not actively maintained but still useful.
