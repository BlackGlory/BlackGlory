**As part of my minimalism,**
**any projects I deem no longer useful will be removed after a post-mortem review.**
**If you rely on one of my repositories,**
**please consider giving it a star so I'm aware.**
**Also, it's always a good idea to keep a copy of anything you need.**

## Stages of Projects

- 🌿 A relatively stable project, may be rewritten.
- 🌲 A developed project.
- 🌳 A very developed project that is difficult to improve further.
- 🍂 A project that is not actively maintained but still useful.
