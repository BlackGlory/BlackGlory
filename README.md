## Stages of Projects
- 🌱 A start-up or experimental project.
- 🌿 A relatively stable project, may be rewritten.
- 🌲 A developed project.
- 🌳 A very developed project that is difficult to improve further.
- 🍂 A project that is not actively maintained but still useful.
  (Projects that I consider useless will be removed immediately after the post-mortem)
